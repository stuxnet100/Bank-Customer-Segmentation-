# Bank_customer_segmentation
## Project Description
The motive of this project is to cluster bank customers based on their spendings, credit limit, minimum & maximum spending etc. to build marketing strategies so that their payment rates can be improved

## Tools Used:
1. Pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization and plotting.
2. Scikit learn library for implementing clustering algorithms. 

## Data Visualization:
1. **Box plots** to visualize outliers, distribution plots to visualize any skewness in the data.
2. **Heat map** to visualize correlation between dependent features.

## Algorithms Used:
1. **Hierarchical clustering** is used, optimal clusters are idnetified using **Dendogram**.
2. **Elbow method** is used to identify optimal number of clusters while using **KMeans clustering algorithm**.
3. **Silhoutte Score** is used to authenticate.

## Conclusions:
The customers have been clustered into 3 groups based on their spendings as high, medium and low spending customers. Based on customer spendings with max payement and probability of full payment appropriate marketing strategies can be applied to increase the payment rates of the customers of each group.
